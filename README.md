# LiDAR-SFM

# Instance Reconstruction Evaluation
We use the same [rosbag](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WpoWz7d5rv1s7l6DpmfL7u7jyJ3XLOmj/view?usp=sharing) to evaluate the proposed method against  [Livox Mapping](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_mapping) and [LOAM Livox](https://github.com/hku-mars/loam_livox). The rosbag was recorded in a garage. The LiDAR follows an elliptical trajectory to scan a vehicle (Mercedes-Benz GLB).  Please refer to the following videos for the details of the rosbag. <br>

In the following, the point clouds are normalized into a unit sphere (i.e. [-1,1]). The first metric is the Chamfer Distance (CD). Given two point sets, the CD is the sum of the squared distance of each point to the nearest point in the other point set: <br>

That is, a smaller CD value indicates a higher fidelity.<br>
The second metric is  the recall of the ground truth points from the reconstructed shape, which is defined as:

A higher Recall indicates a higher fidelity. <br>
The script to run the quantitative comparison and the PCD files for the point clouds are available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/108GugB5e8sS_BZuOAMgFwMsDRQvkD0qE/view?usp=sharing).

## Requirements
* GTSAM <br>
First, please ensure you can run the python demos given by [GTSAM](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam/tree/develop).<br>
We found that GTSAM cannot be installed appropriately with a conda environment. Thus, a conda environment is not recommended. Otherwise, errors will be reported when you use BearingRangeFactor3D or BetweenFactorPose3.

* IILFM <br>
A light and insertable version of [IILFM](https://github.com/York-SDCNLab/IILFM) is included in the files. To build and run it, you need to install basic tools like cmake.<br>

* Python Packages <br>
The following packages are required. <br>
[AprilTag](https://pypi.org/project/apriltag/) <br>
[opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)<br>
[networkx](https://pypi.org/project/networkx/) <br>
[open3d](https://pypi.org/project/open3d/) <br>
[scipy](https://scipy.org/install/) <br>
[matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)<br>
opencv-python(cv2) has a built-in ArUco detector. Please ensure you can run the python demos of [ArUco detection](https://pyimagesearch.com/2020/12/21/detecting-aruco-markers-with-opencv-and-python/). Again, a conda environment is not recommended. <br>



## Commands
```git clone https://github.com/York-SDCNLab/IILFM.git](https://github.com/yorklyb/LiDAR-SFM.git```<br>
```cd LiDAR-SFM```<br>
```cd lidar-sfm```<br>
```cd iilfm```<br>
```mkdir build```<br>
```cd build```<br>
```cmake ..```<br>
```make```<br>
```mv tag_detection ../../```<br>
Make sure that the point clouds are named by '1.pcd','2.pcd',..., and are put into a folder named 'pc'. Folder pc are in the same path of main.py.
```python3 main.py```<br>
Then, you will see a output file named out.pcd.
